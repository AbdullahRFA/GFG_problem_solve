"""
Given an array arr[] containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Sort the array in ascending order.

You need to solve this problem without utilizing the built-in sort function.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.

Follow up: Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?
"""
"""
‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:

The algorithm uses three pointers:
	‚Ä¢	low: Points to the boundary of the 0s region.
	‚Ä¢	mid: Traverses the array and checks elements.
	‚Ä¢	high: Points to the boundary of the 2s region.

üîÅ Logic:
	‚Ä¢	If arr[mid] == 0: Swap with arr[low], increment both low and mid.
	‚Ä¢	If arr[mid] == 1: Just move mid forward.
	‚Ä¢	If arr[mid] == 2: Swap with arr[high], decrement high (don‚Äôt increment mid yet!).
